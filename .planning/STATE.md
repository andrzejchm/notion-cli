## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 32 requirements — Foundation → Search → Pages → Databases → Ship
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Page Reading) and Phase 4 (Database Operations) can execute in parallel — both depend on Phase 2 but not each other
- [Research]: notion-to-md v3 + SDK v5 compatibility is the biggest unknown — test early in Phase 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- notion-to-md v3 compatibility with @notionhq/client v5 needs validation (Phase 3 risk)
